                The next step in this project is developing "gold standard" NLP datasets which can be used to train more
                sophisticated models. The project is currently being done through Doccanno in order to tag 10 different
                entity types specific to the healthcare field.

            <p>
                The labels and format of the dataset are in the following form:

            <p>
                The demand for such data is high as models trained on non-medical data are useless when trying to
                identify important medical entities. "Gold Standard" datasets such as this will allow the utility of
                these models to reach the field of healthcare and make a real impact for professionals and patients.
